                <ol>
                    <li>Pygmy hippopotamuses are smaller than their larger relatives, the common hippopotamus. They typically weigh between 160 to 270 kg.</li>
                    <li>They are native to the forests and swamps of West Africa, particularly in countries like Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Ivory Coast.</li>
                    <li>Pygmy hippos are more solitary than common hippos and are primarily nocturnal, spending most of their time in dense vegetation near water sources.</li>
                    <li>They have a unique adaptation that allows them to close their nostrils and ears when submerged in water, helping them stay underwater for extended periods.</li>
                    <li>Pygmy hippos are classified as endangered due to habitat loss and hunting, with an estimated population of fewer than 3,000 individuals in the wild.</li>

                <h2>Online fame and what it has brought</h2>
                <p>In response to her viral fame, Khao Kheow Open Zoo has seen a significant increase in visitors, with many people eager to see Moo Deng in person. </p>
                <p>The zoo has also launched a merchandise line featuring Moo Deng's image to raise funds for themselves.</p>
                <p>Sadly, the popularity comes with some downsides. Some visitors have been reported to harass the hippo by throwing objects or splashing water at her.</p>
                <p>The zoo has taken this seriously, installing security cameras and threatening legal action.</p>
                <p>Despite the huge popularity online, it is sadly reported that there has been no significant impact observed in terms of funding for pigmy hippo conservation and protection.</p>
